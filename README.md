# Malaria-Detection-Using-CNNs-and-ML
**PROJECT TITLE: Identification of Malaria in Microscopy Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks: InceptionV3 vs. MobileNetV2**
This a project for my final year as a Computer Science Student at The Papua New Guinea University of Technology. In this project, I evaluate the performances of two architectures 1. InceptionV3 and 2. MobileNetV2 in detecting and classifying microscopy images, whether it has parasitized cells or not. A simple windows app is then implemented
The add will also implement ML features for real time detection using YOLO for object detection
